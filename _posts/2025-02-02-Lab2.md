# Prelab
Sensor I2C Address:

Scan the I2C channel to find the sensor
Go to File->Examples->Apollo3->Wire and open Example1_wire_I2C
Browse through the code to see how to use i2c commands.
Run the code. Does the address match what you expected? If not, explain why.

> We will use two ToF sensors. The address of the sensor is hardwired on the board which means you cannot (as is) address the two sensors individually. You can change the address programmatically (while powered) or you can continuously enable/disable the two sensors separately through their shutdown pins. Decide and argue for which approach you want to use (and how you will do this). Given their range and angular sensitivity, think about where you will place them on your robot to best detect obstacles in future labs. Discuss scenarios where your robot will miss obstacles.
