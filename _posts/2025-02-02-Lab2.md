## Setup the IMU

I connected the IMU to the Artemis Nano using the braided QWIC connector, as show below.

![Connection](/assets/img/lab2/connection.jpg)

Then, I installed the SparkFun ICM-20948 library in the Arduino IDE and ran the example code.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='s0FzFAuVIeU' %}

AD0_VAL defines the last bit of the IMU's I2C address. Since we are only using one IMU in this lab, AD0_VAL should be set to the default of 1. Being able to change the I2C address on the IMU allows for the daisy-chaining of multiple IMUs steming from the same I2C connection.

When the board is placed flat on the table, it experiences no acceleration in the x and y directions, but it is pulled downwards in the z-direction by gravity. In the beginning of the serial plot video above, we can see that the acceleration value in the z-direction is around 1000. The x, y, and z values on the serial plotter are higher when the respective axis is feels the pull of gravity, or some other more strongly.

While the accelerometer measures linear acceleration, a gyroscope measures angular velocity. This means that the gyroscope produces all zero outputs if the board is perfectly still, but will produce an output at the appropriate axis if moved.

I added a visual indication that the board is running by blinking the LED three times on startup. I did this using the same BlinkWithoutDelay example code as lab 1.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='Fg_Rk-NJHLw' %}

```cpp
if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval && blinks < BLINKS_ON_STARTUP) {
    // save the last time you blinked the LED
    previousMillis = currentMillis;

    // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
    if (ledState == LOW) {
        ledState = HIGH;
    } else {
        ledState = LOW;
        blinks = blinks + 1;
    }
    // set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
}

```

## Accelerometer

I used the equations from class to convert accelerometer data to pitch and roll. Sadly, yaw can not be calculated from accelerometer data, but can be done using the gyroscope.

```cpp
theta = atan2(myICM.accX(), myICM.accZ())  * (180.0 / M_PI); // Pitch
phi = atan2(myICM.accY(), myICM.accZ())  * (180.0 / M_PI);   // Roll
```

### Pitch and Roll

Pitch = 0, Roll = 0
![PitchZeroRollZero](/assets/img/lab2/pitch0roll0.png)

Pitch = 0, Roll = -90
![PitchZeroRollZero](/assets/img/lab2/pitch0roll-90.png)

Pitch = 0, Roll = 90
![PitchZeroRollZero](/assets/img/lab2/pitch0roll90.png)

Pitch = 90, Roll = 0
![PitchZeroRollZero](/assets/img/lab2/pitch90roll0.png)

Pitch = -90, Roll = 0
![PitchZeroRollZero](/assets/img/lab2/pitch-90roll0.png)

### Jupyter Plotting
I used Bluetooth to send accelerometer data from the board to my PC. To capture 5 seconds of data, around 2000 data points are needed. It took around 58 seconds to send each point individually, which made testing tedious. To solve this problem, I appended several data points to each transmission and modified my notification handler to parse the data and organize it into arrays. Then, it was easy to plot the time domain graph using Matplotlib. Sending the data in batches of 3 to 5 decreased the transmission time to 10 seconds.

### Accuracy

My accelerometer is accurate within 5 degrees of error. To perform a two-point calibration, I measured two known angles (-90 degrees and 90 degrees). Then, I assumed that the sensor is linear between these two points, and created a calibration equation to ensure accuracy. I do this for both pitch and roll. Here is the sample code for pitch calibration. Roll calibration is done the same way.

```cpp
float calibratedPitch(float reading){
  float A1;
  float A2; 
  float m;
  float b;

  A2 = 86;
  A1 = -87;
  m  = 180.0 / (A2 - A1);
  b = - 90 - m * A1 ;

  return m * reading + b;
}
```

### Noise & FFT Analysis
Shown below are the time domain and frequency domain graphs for the pitch while the wobbling the IMU back and forth, with the RC car in its proximity.

![NoisyData](/assets/img/lab2/pitch_next_to_car.png)

The time-domain signal tracks the movement pretty accurately, but the edges are jagged, revealing the sensor's sensitivity to high-frequency motor noise. I think there is relatively low noise because there is a hardware low-pass filter built-in. Looking at the frequency domain above, we can see two spikes. The spike at 1-2 Hz is the intended wobbling motion. The 10 Hz spike is the motor vibration. To get a better idea of where to set the cutoff frequency, I decided induce some random vibrational noise by hitting the table at random intervals.

![InducedVibration](/assets/img/lab2/induced_vibration.png)

The spikes in roll are when I hit the table, and it's seemingly random whether it spikes up or down. I decided to set the cut-off frequency to 10Hz. It would be sufficient to cut out the majority of high-frequency noise, while mostly preserving intentional movements. Here is the calculation of alpha:

$$f=\frac{1}{2\pi RC}$$

$$RC=\frac{1}{2\pi 10} = 0.0159154943092$$

$$T=0.002$$

$$\alpha=\frac{T}{T+RC}$$

$$\alpha=\frac{0.002}{0.002+0.0159154943092}=0.11$$

### Simple Lowpass Filter

Using this value of alpha, I low-passed roll and pitch signals to achieve the results shown below:

![LPFRoll](/assets/img/lab2/lowpassed_roll.png)
![LPFRoll](/assets/img/lab2/lowpassed_pitch.png)

The low pass filter was able to signifigantly reduce noise in pitch and roll, as evidenced by the FFTs.

## Gyroscope
I found the roll, pitch, and yaw from the equations from class. 
```cpp
dt = (micros() - last_time)/1000000.;
last_time = micros();

pitch_g = pitch_g + myICM.gyrY()*dt;
roll_g = roll_g + myICM.gyrX()*dt;
yaw_g = yaw_g + myICM.gyrZ()*dt;
```

### Comparision to Accelerometer

![GyroData](/assets/img/lab2/stationary_gyro_accel_pitch.png)

When the IMU is stationary, it can be seen the pitch and roll of the gyro scope matches that of the accelerometer pretty well. There is signifigantly less noise in the gyroscope reading, at the cost of some minor drifting. The FFTs shows that the noise is negligible when there is no movement.

![GyroData](/assets/img/lab2/moving_gyro_accel_pitch.png)

When we add some wobbling to the IMU, the drift becomes more prevalent. 

### Sampling Frequency
As I decreased sampling frequency, changes in pitch, roll, and yaw become more eratic, and drift increases in severity. I want to have as high of a sampling frequency as possible by decreasing delays and speeding up the main loop.

### Complementary Filter

![CompPitch](/assets/img/lab2/complementary_pitch.png)
![CompRoll](/assets/img/lab2/complementary_roll.png)

For the pitch measurement, I moved the IMU eratically for the first half of the measurement, and then wobbled it up and down shakily for the second half. Unsurprisingly, the accelerometer data is very noisy, and the gyroscope data drifts downwards. However, the complementary filter takes both into account and gives a reasonable signal free from quick vibration and drift. The roll measurements show similar results.

## Sample Data

### Speed Up Execution
I took the following steps to speed up execution of the main loop
- IMU is only sampled when it signals that the data is ready.
- Deleted all delay statements from the code. The blink on startup was changed to working without using `delay()`. 
- Removed all `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()` statements.
- Send data point in batches instead of individually. Amount of data points in each batch depends on how many chars are needed to represent the data.
- My program is able to sample new values at about 400 samples per second.
- The main loop does not run faster than the IMU can sample new values.

### Time Stamped Data Points

![TimeStamped](/assets/img/lab2/time_stamped_data.png)
### Data Storage
- For this lab, it makes more sense to store accelerometer and gyroscope data in seperate arrays. If I only want to send data from one type of sensor, having seperate arrays means that less data needs to be loaded into the cache. Additionally having seperate arrays makes the code easier to understand and maintain. The main advantage of having a single array is that data points from different sensors can be paired. By including timestamps with each measurement, synchronization can still be achieved using seperate arrays.
- Different data types should be used to store different types of data. For the time stamps, I am using the `millis()` command, which returns a whole number representing the amount of milliseconds that have passed since the start of the program. For time, there is no need to have sub-millisecond granularity, so it should be stored as an int. For data points such as pitch, roll, and yaw. I decided to use floats because high-frequency noise can have an amplitude of less than 0.5 degrees. Capturing this high frequency noise is important for determining a cutoff frequency for the filters. 
- After uploading my program, the Artemis has 267904 bytes left for local variables. If each message is 151 chars (151 bytes), and each message can contain 3 data points, then my program can store nearly 600s of IMU data before memory overflow.
